# TensorFlowJS_Practises
The first practise of building a classifier model with tensorflow.js.
The experiment is based on exercise from Coursera Course :Browser-based Models with TensorFlow.js 

## Dataset
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
This dataset can be found at [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)


## Model
A basic handwriting classifier that was trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
The model was built and trained on tf.js 


## Labels

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:
* T-shirt/top
* Trouser
* Pullover
* Dress
* Coat
* Sandal
